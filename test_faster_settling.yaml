# Test Configuration for Faster Settling Time
# Current excellent overshoot (0-10.8%) allows for higher gains

# Test 1: Moderate Increase (Safe)
controller_settings:
  pid:
    kp: 4.5      # +45% from current 3.1
    ki: 0.6      # +50% from current 0.4  
    kd: 3.0      # +36% from current 2.2
    
    # Keep same limits for safety
    output_min_x: -10.0
    output_max_x: 10.0
    output_min_y: -8.0
    output_max_y: 12.0
    
    # Enhanced features (already working well)
    enable_derivative_filter: true
    derivative_filter_alpha: 0.1
    enable_feedforward: true
    velocity_feedforward_gain: 0.8
    acceleration_feedforward_gain: 0.1

# Expected Performance:
# - Overshoot: 5-15% (still excellent)
# - Settling time: 10-14s (40% improvement)
# - Stability: High (conservative increase)

# Test 2: Balanced Increase (Recommended)
controller_settings:
  pid:
    kp: 5.5      # +77% from current 3.1
    ki: 0.8      # +100% from current 0.4
    kd: 3.5      # +59% from current 2.2
    
    # Same enhanced features
    enable_derivative_filter: true
    derivative_filter_alpha: 0.08  # Slightly more filtering for higher gains
    enable_feedforward: true
    velocity_feedforward_gain: 0.9  # Increased for faster tracking

# Expected Performance:
# - Overshoot: 8-18% (still within target)
# - Settling time: 8-12s (significant improvement)
# - Best balance of speed and stability

# Test 3: Maximum Safe Increase (Aggressive)
controller_settings:
  pid:
    kp: 7.0      # +126% from current 3.1  
    ki: 1.0      # +150% from current 0.4
    kd: 4.5      # +105% from current 2.2
    
    # Increased output limits for aggressive control
    output_min_x: -15.0
    output_max_x: 15.0
    output_min_y: -12.0
    output_max_y: 18.0
    
    # Enhanced filtering for higher gains
    enable_derivative_filter: true
    derivative_filter_alpha: 0.05  # More aggressive filtering
    enable_feedforward: true
    velocity_feedforward_gain: 1.0

# Expected Performance:
# - Overshoot: 12-20% (at target limit)
# - Settling time: 6-10s (target achieved)
# - Requires careful tuning and monitoring
